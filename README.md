# Hi! I'm Guillermina 👋🏼

### I'm a data scientist about to turn into a data engineer. 

:pencil2:  I'm currently teaching myself **PySpark**, **Airflow**, and how to download, process, and transform data through the **command line**.


I have experience:
- querying data
- building machine learning models (classification, regression, and clustering)
- time series modeling and forecasting
- data mining
- statistical analysis tools

:bar_chart:  I have also dedicated the past three years of my life to communicating complex ideas through insightful **data visualizations**.

🧠  I'm also interested in **deep learning** models and how AI can help us humans navigate daily life.

👩🏻 In my free time you'll find me at a box doing CrossFit, studying German/Dutch, or reading existentialist authors (aka Kafka, Camus, Dostoevsky).
