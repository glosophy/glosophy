# Hi! I'm Guillermina 👋🏼 

### I'm a data scientist interested in dataviz and data engineering.

:pencil2:  I'm currently teaching myself **[d3.js](https://github.com/glosophy/d3)** and **[Processing](https://github.com/glosophy/processing)**. 


I have experience:
- querying data
- building machine learning models (classification, regression, and clustering)
- time series modeling and forecasting
- data mining
- statistical analysis tools

:bar_chart:  I have also dedicated the past five years of my life to communicating complex ideas through insightful **data visualizations**. You can check out my talks on data visualization [here](https://github.com/glosophy/DataVizTalks).

🧠  I'm also interested in **deep learning** models and how AI can help us humans navigate daily life.

👩🏻 In my free time you'll find me at a box doing CrossFit, studying German/Dutch, playing the cello or listening to podcasts.

🔒 Blockchain, crypto, and open source technology are the future.
