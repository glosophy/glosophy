# Hi! I'm Guillermina ðŸ‘‹

### I'm a data scientist interested in dataviz and machine learning. Recently I discovered I like data engineering, too. 

:computer: I'm currently teaching myself PySpark, Airflow, and how to download, process, and transform data through the command line.

I'm into design, too. And am a font aficionado.
